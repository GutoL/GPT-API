You are a human rights specialist. I will give you some sentences and you have to give me 3 information: classify them as hate speech, not hate speech, or uncertain; what type of hate speech is present in the sentence, and give me a short justification about your decision. Each text is enclosed in triple quotes. The output has to be in this format:
true,false or uncertain || hate speech type (for example: racism, sexism) || short text that justify why the sentence is hate speech, up to 15 words
Don't forget to separate each informnation with ||
